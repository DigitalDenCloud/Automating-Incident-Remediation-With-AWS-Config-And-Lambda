### Tech Stack
------------------
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AWS Config
- AWS Lambda
- AWS CloudWatch

### Project Description
-----------------
Used the AWS Config service to monitor changes to specific resources in my AWS account, such as Amazon EC2 security group settings. Defined which inbound ports should and shouldn't be open in a security group.

Used AWS Config to identify changes that could be a security concern, such as a user modifying an Amazon EC2 security group. Integrated AWS Config with AWS Lambda to automatically remediate specific security incidents of concern. For example, where someone modified a security group's inbound rules and they no longer conform with the desired configuration.

### Objectives
-----------------
- [x] Create IAM roles to grant AWS services access to other AWS services.
- [x] Enable AWS Config to monitor resources in my AWS account.
- [x] Create a Lambda function and import function code.
- [x] Create and enable a custom AWS Config rule that uses my Lambda function.
- [x] Test the behaviour of an AWS Config rule to ensure it works as intended.
- [x] Analyse Amazon CloudWatch logs to audit when AWS Config rules are invoked.
